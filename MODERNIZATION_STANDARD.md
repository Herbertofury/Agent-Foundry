# Continuous Modernization & Fix-Forward Standard

Agent Foundry does not preserve stale implementation choices by default.

## Best-in-class baseline
For substantive technical work, first identify the strongest credible current baseline/challengers. The goal is protected parity plus a real user-valued advantage where the constraints permit one. Reuse or compose superior authorized pieces instead of rebuilding weaker duplicates, and require equivalent-work evidence before claiming superiority.

## Frontier stack selection
For greenfield work and touched architecture with stack freedom, begin from the strongest current best-fit frontier/bleeding-edge candidate set using current primary sources. Stable is the floor, not always the ceiling: evaluate preview/nightly/commit-level/successor technology when it offers a material advantage. Promote only candidates that pass compatibility, security, maintainability, supportability, reproducibility, performance/quality, and no-loss proof. Pin versions/provenance. Preserve explicit target envelopes and backport/adapt frontier techniques when direct adoption is impossible.

## Freshness pass
For substantive version-sensitive work:
1. identify the exact compatibility envelope;
2. check current primary sources and strong challengers;
3. prefer the newest production-worthy compatible method with demonstrated advantage;
4. backport or adapt newer techniques when the target version itself must remain fixed.

## Upgrades are candidates, not automatic wins
A newer version is not better merely because it is newer. Promote it only after evidence shows a material gain without unacceptable protected regression.

For mixed upgrades:
- profile or bisect the change;
- retain useful gains;
- patch or replace regressive internals;
- retest equivalent work;
- preserve the user's target envelope.

## Fix forward
When modernization causes repairable fallout, repair the migration rather than retreating to weaker architecture solely because the older path is familiar.

## Reusable improvement ratchet
Once a newer method is verified as materially better:
- record why;
- preserve its compatibility assumptions;
- make it the reusable default;
- add regression protection where practical.

## Challenger relationship
Modernization and challenger discovery are linked but not identical:
- modernization asks “what is the strongest current compatible baseline?”;
- challenger discovery asks “what existing implementations can we adopt, merge, port, wrap, backport, or compose?”

Use both when substantial invention or migration is involved.

## Stack decision evidence

For a material stack choice, record the target envelope, candidate versions/support status, dated primary-source links, expected advantage, relevant comparative proof, migration cost and rollback path. Reuse current evidence until a load-bearing fact or target changes. Research is bounded by the actual decision; documentation-only changes do not require an unrelated stack migration.

Evaluate frontier candidates alongside the strongest supported production baseline. Preview/nightly technology remains a candidate until supportability and reproducibility are demonstrated for the real target. Pin the selected versions and lockfiles; record why a newer candidate was rejected rather than floating production to arbitrary HEAD. This implements invariant 18's promotion gate and preserves invariant 9's production-worthy requirement.

Examples of primary-source decision inputs, checked 2026-10-04:
- [Node.js release/support policy](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases): production applications use Active or Maintenance LTS; a higher Current version alone is not a production recommendation.
- [React's application guidance](https://react.dev/learn/creating-a-react-app): compare framework capabilities and deployment requirements for a new React application. This is input to a React decision, not a requirement that every project use React or one specific framework.
- For user-facing work, apply [DESIGN_QUALITY_STANDARD.md](DESIGN_QUALITY_STANDARD.md) and its current W3C/Playwright/Web Vitals references. A newer library does not establish visual quality.

Verify the relevant official support matrix again when making a future version-sensitive decision; these links are a research route, not a frozen version mandate.
