# Failure Intelligence Standard

Failures are state transitions, not excuses and not deliverables.

## State model
Use explicit states:
- \`verified\`
- \`unverified\`
- \`unresolved-active\`
- \`blocked-user-action\`
- \`superseded\`

Do not translate “first search missed it” into “does not exist.”

## Blocker escalation
When a required path fails:
1. capture the decisive failure signature;
2. preserve partial valid work;
3. classify the failure family;
4. change route, parameters, environment, implementation, or authorization state;
5. retry only when new evidence or a state transition exists;
6. continue independent acceptance work when possible.

Never loop an unchanged failure.

## Reusable incident knowledge
A nontrivial verified recovery should capture:
- signature;
- environment/version;
- root cause;
- failed routes;
- successful route;
- verification evidence;
- invalidation conditions;
- regression protection.

Future work must reuse or supersede that knowledge before rediscovering the same failure from scratch.

## Completeness
For exhaustive external data:
- reconcile expected, discovered, accepted, rejected, and unresolved counts;
- prove terminal pagination/coverage before claiming completeness;
- preserve unresolved gaps explicitly.

## Anti-stall rule
Two consecutive execution waves that add no evidence, reduce no uncertainty, advance no dependency, mutate no required deliverable, and satisfy no acceptance item force a strategy change.
