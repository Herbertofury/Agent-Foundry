# Challenger & Integration Standard

> **Challenge before reinventing. Compose the strongest authorized pieces.**

This standard governs substantial invention, integration, modernization, conversion, migration, performance engineering, and tooling work.

## Search surface
Use a bounded, relevance-driven pass across upstream projects, GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg, significant forks, package/plugin ecosystems, standards, reference implementations, mature libraries/frameworks, and authorized internal/commercial implementations when relevant.

## Candidate decisions

| Decision | Meaning |
|---|---|
| <code>adopt</code> | use substantially as-is |
| <code>merge</code> | ingest useful internals into the target |
| <code>port</code> | move implementation across version/platform/runtime |
| <code>wrap</code> | keep implementation behind a stable adapter |
| <code>backport</code> | bring a newer technique to an older fixed target |
| <code>compose</code> | combine best-of-breed pieces from multiple candidates |
| <code>reject</code> | evidence shows the candidate is not a fit |
| <code>unresolved</code> | more evidence is genuinely needed |

## Evidence to capture
For load-bearing candidates record source/provenance, version/date, authorization or license status where relevant, exact-target compatibility, capability/fidelity advantages, performance implications, maintenance fit, and decision rationale.

## Reuse-before-rebuild
If an authorized mature implementation already solves the hard part better, do not recreate an inferior duplicate merely to avoid integration work.

## Composition is first-class
Do not force one winner when the strongest system can combine different candidates' best parser, cache, compatibility layer, UI behavior, or orchestration.

## Anti-research-stall
Once the high-value search space is covered and the integration set is actionable, cross into implementation. Further read-only work requires a named correctness blocker.

## Acceptance
A challenger pass succeeds when it materially changes confidence, design, or implementation—or establishes with evidence that custom implementation remains the strongest route.
